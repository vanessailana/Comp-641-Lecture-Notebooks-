    "\n",
    "Step 1: Install Anaconda (if you have not already)\n",
    "– Go to: https://www.anaconda.com/download\n",
    "– Download the installer for your operating system (Windows, macOS, or Linux).\n",
    "– Run the installer and accept the default options.\n",
    "– This will install Python and Jupyter Notebook together.\n",
    "\n",
    "Step 2: Launch Jupyter\n",
    "Option A: Using Anaconda Navigator\n",
    "– Open “Anaconda Navigator”.\n",
    "– Click on “Jupyter Notebook” or “JupyterLab”.\n",
    "– A browser window will open (usually at http://localhost:8888).\n",
    "\n",
    "Option B: Using the terminal or command prompt\n",
    "– Open a terminal (macOS/Linux) or Anaconda Prompt (Windows).\n",
    "– Type: jupyter notebook\n",
    "– Press Enter.\n",
    "– A browser window will open.\n",
    "\n",
    "Step 3: Create a new notebook\n",
    "– In the browser interface, navigate to a folder where you want to save your work.\n",
    "– Click “New” → “Python 3 (ipykernel)” or similar.\n",
    "– A new, empty notebook will open in a new tab.\n",
    "\n",
    "Step 4: Rename the notebook\n",
    "– At the top of the notebook, click the name (e.g., “Untitled”).\n",
    "– Rename it to: Week01.ipynb\n",
    "– Press Enter to save the new name.\n",
    "\n",
    "Step 5: Learn the basics of cells\n",
    "– A Jupyter Notebook is made up of “cells”.\n",
    "– Code cells: you write Python code and run it.\n",
    "– Markdown cells: you write text (notes, headings, explanations).\n",
    "– To run the current cell: press Shift + Enter.\n",
    "– To add a new cell: use the “+” button or Insert menu."
